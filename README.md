# kotlin-multiplatform
Just wanted to demo some kotlin multiplatform things

## KMMApp
following [the tutorial](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Networking%20and%20Data%20Storage%20with%20Kotlin%20Multiplatfrom%20Mobile/01_Introduction) on a KMM app. I wrote this on windows so I never tested the iOS side.
